## zensdomains overview ##

> zensdomains is a domain name project planned to be built on HorizenEON EVM, decentralized exchange, multi-signature

Zensdomains (domain name) is our core product. Domain names ending in .zen are sold for profit. Domain price for one year: 

$5 (4-character domain name and more)

$25 (3-character domain name) 

$125 (2-character domain name)

$625 (1-character domain name).

Zenswap (decentralized exchange) is based on uniswap v2, users can trade zen evm tokens in zenswap, and the team will get a small fee profit from the transaction.

Multi-signature, a smart contract wallet running on zen evm, requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can happen (M-of-N).

## ZENS APP

### Zens on Horizen EON EVM

ZENS Name Service (ZENS) is a distributed, open and scalable naming system based on the HorizenEON EVM blockchain.

ZENS works by mapping human-readable names like "alice.zen" to machine-readable identifiers like Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata.

ZENS also supports "reverse resolution", which makes it possible to associate metadata (such as canonical names or interface descriptions) with Ethereum addresses.
